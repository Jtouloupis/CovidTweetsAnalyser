"#Covid_19 Government Measures

Must watch - well made video 

Just in case you forgot what they did

- Manipulated no.Covid deaths to drive agenda 
- 24/7 MSM & big tech propaganda fear campaign 
- Shut down schools
- Masked children
- Isolated vulnerable people 
- Shut down small business
- Suicides & mental health increase
- Stopped you seeing dying relatives 
- Wasted millions on furlough, PPE & failed track & trace systems
- Censored & banned credible dissenting voices 

This doesnt even cover the ineffective, dangerous  use of Midazolam/Remdesivir horrors or the origins & continued gain of function research.

NOW - ask yourself WHY all this happened & continue to WAKE up as many people as possible QUICKLY.

"While children are less likely than adults to get seriously ill or die from Covid, they are just as susceptible to infection and just as easily spread the disease to others as adults do. (Proven fact.) A significant proportion of our population is at risk of death regardless of whether they've been vaccinated -- the elderly, cancer patients, etc. Those groups are being killed by unvaccinated people who are spreading this disease to them. Colin Powell was likely killed by some unvaccinated person who unwittingly infected him with Covid. Get vaccinated. Consider others, not just yourself.",0,

I think if somebody is unvaccinated but had Covid then a positive antibody test should be a medical reason for not getting the vaccine. Theres not much discussion now of natural immunity being part of achieving herd immunity which is odd to me. The CDC studies Ive seen show less than 1% of those with natural immunity are reinfected. I get regular antibody tests and still have strong antibodies after 9 months which is longer right now than the estimated immunity from the vaccine since they are talking about needing a booster after 6 months.,0,

Pregnant and breastfeeding women should not get the COVID-19 vaccine.,1,
"If employees are so uneducated and backward they refuse vaccines they may not be the kind of employees you want in the first place. You want the job, get vaccinated.",0,
There are severe side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines.,1,
Vaccinated people are still much less likely to be hospitalized or die because of COVID-19.,0,
Vaccinate yourself for good health and mask up.,0,
I am delighfull to get my first dose of vaccine,0,
I feel more healthy after taking the first dose,0,
vaccination is a neccessity,0,
I know many people who for health reasons have been told not to get the shot.,1,
A vaccine may temporarily affect your period,1,
Im not going to be a Guinea pig for a rushed vaccine that has barely been studied.,1,
Half of you are crazy. Why would anyone take the vaccine,1,
Absolutely not nobody knows what kind of side effects it might have.,1,
"Thank you Betsy DeVos, Thank you Donald, oops I mean, Ron DeSantis, Thank you Former Guy in Mar-a-Lago.

"80 thousand football maskless fans cheering their football teams at packed stadiums across the country. Thousands standing shoulder to shoulder without the obedience masks at hockey games. Every day we eat at restaurants, maskless. We shop at malls, maskless, we go to clubs, maskless. Meanwhile, COVID infection rates are rapidly declining. Yet our kids are forced to wear face diapers for 8 hours a day for no other reason than to control. For the sake of power. Nurses and doctors who heroically dealt with and nursed patients back from the brink of death during the onset of COVID when it wasnot known what effect the virus would have on them, many who got COVID and now have the antibodies are being fired, because they choose not to take the vacine. Cops, firefighters, teachers, air traffic controllers, pilots also. ESPN reporter Allison Williams who is trying to concieve a child and was told by her doctor not to take the vaccine, was fired. But this is what bothers the Miami Herald. That a school says kids who take the vaccine must be quarantined for 30 days at home. It's a private school. Parents can choose to take their kids out, but they don't. It doesn't bother the parents, but it bothers the Miami Herald.",1,
The new covid cases are 7 to 1 vaccianted to those whom had covid and have natural immunity.But you blind indoctrinated sheep just spew idiocy here day and night.,1,
Miki Elior Like Colin Powell died. Fully vaccinated. My point exactly.,1,
"Candy Perrita BS! Many more unvaccinated are dying than the vaccinated. Yes, you can get it and spread it after being vaccinated but you have a much greater chance of not being hospitalized nor dying. During the Delta surge 97% of the hospitalized and 99% of the deaths were unvaccinated people. Ya' frickin' DING DONG!",0,
"When will this lunacy end? For decades we have faced health emergencies/epidemics and the public have all responded responsibly. I dutifully lined up to get my polio vaccine and my parents were so relieved that I most probably would escape the ravishes of polio. But today, because Trump tells them there is no need for a vaccine (and DeSantis also promotes that misinformation), irresponsible, irrational, illogical, reckless people refuse the established public health protocols and we are all going to die because of it. Mindless and indefensible. If you refuse to be vaccinated and to wear a mask, stay home and do not come out and infect me with your stupid, politically motivated behavior. Remember, it is not just all about yourself as Trump says. Rather it is responsibility for the entire community. What about 'We the people....' do you not understand?",0,
Complete and Total LUNACY in our midst. 0Always better to be SAFE than SORRY. Always better to be CAREFUL than CARELESS. Always better to think LOGICALLY than listen to RUMORS. ?,0,
"So, explain how and why very close to 100% of the COVID patients in the hospitals, on ventilators, and dying are unvaccinated! The data could not be clearer. Only the pathetically incompetent, irrational, illogical, irresponsible, and reckless would continue to refuse to be vaccinated and to wear masks when in close contact with others. These are the same people who drive on the 826 at 90 mph with their eyes closed. Mindless. Dios Mio.",0,
"Chuck, come on now, the reason for children & teachers wearing masks (they're not diapers!) in a closed classroom is totally necessary, to keep students & staff from catching this plague-- Too many people are still dying, & children should not be put in the middle of this pandemic! The solution is for all people worldwide, children, parents, nurses & doctors to get both shots of this fully necessary FDA approved vaccine, to lower the number of cases and deaths by the end of 2021!",0,

I will be happy with my two Pfizer vaccines,0,
But your vaccine will protect you!,0,
The vaccine is a blessing on us,0,
No side effects after the vaccine had my second one and feeling great,0,
I am happy that I got vaccinated.I am safe.,0,
I?m so sick of reading about people dying with or without a vaccine. ,1,
Too many health issues with this vaccine.,1,
I have read a lot of harmful effects including death if taken the vaccine,1,
This is not a vaccine it is a death shot,1,
There are some people who have died from the vaccine but they're not ready to talk about that...,1,
Thank you to all the employees who value the health and lives of Washingtons people.,1,
"I am not surprised by the vaccination rates jumping up the WSP and I guarantee SPD numbers will go up too!! I knew when it came down to it these officers are not going to lose $100,000 a year job over a vaccines shot! Not too many other job paying that kind of money.",1,
"The percentage jumped as the total number of those that didnt quit, transfer out of state, or take early retirement shrank.that should make you feel safe.",1,
"The reality is that a lot of people really do respond to mandates. We dont use them much here in Japan besides obvious things like enrolling kids in school or working in healthcare, but that is because almost everybody seems eager to get vaccinated. Hence they arent as necessary as they are in the US. In an ironic sense, vaccine refusal directly leads to vaccine mandates.",1,
"The really encouraging thing is that the protection against hospitalization (and thus against death) shows no signs of waning after 6 months. The protection against infection does wane quite a bit, but remains quite significant compared to not being vaccinated.",1,
Just like a flu vaccine! But with MORE effectiveness. No surprise at all. And as long as 1/4 of the population remains unvaccinated and riding on the coat tails of those that are. We are just going to have to repeat and repeat??,0,
"90% for six months. Lol. Just trying to walk the line between we told you this was effective, but now, we really want to sell you boosters too.",0,
lol so now they're protecting us from hospitalizations? What about protecting us from the virus? You can't make this up.,0,
"Stop with your bullshit propaganda, not everybody is asleep. Why don't you expose the corruption of the CDC numbers? They are reporting people who died from vaccine reactions as unvaccinated to keep the numbers up. Why don't you publish new info from israel that shows people who have recovered and have natural immunity have a lower Risk by factor of 7 for re- infection compared to those who are vaccinated. It's right there on their govt health website. They are not politically biased and corrupted by big pharma like the medical establishment here. Not afraid of something with a lower death rate than the flu. Recently caught Delta variant my son brought home from school, a little bit of a runny nose and a sore throat for one day and a very light productive cough. Super easy to get over, barely an inconvenience. American News is not and has not been real journalism for decades. It's all about pushing whatever the current narrative is with a fervor comparable to Nazi propaganda. You suck ass Seattle Times",0,
"It's crazy that people are allowing their political views to influence them on something that should be a non-political subject, and something that is good for all of us.",0,
Really Most of the Delta variant infections are in the unvaccinated but there are breakthroughs in the vaccinated because this variant came out after the vaccines were developed. The unvaccinated will be responsible for additional variants that may cause even more breakthrough infections. We NEED to have herd immunity to overcome this virus!,0,
It is ignorance and belief in conspiracy theories that cause people to make stupid decisions. I got my vaccine in February. Think about Polio and Small Pox! When I was in elementary school they came into the school and vaccinated all the children. Both diseases were eradicated due to vaccines. This is no different.,0,
"By the way, I signed up to receive the vaccine immediately. Even though I am a healthcare worker, I did not receive my (first) vaccine until this past Monday. I was sick all week. With all of the information and mis-information that's been put out, the only reason I received the vaccine was to hopefully protect those that I care for. If I were on my own, I would have waited as well.",0,
Get vaccinated. Don't let your fear cheat you or anyone out of life.,0,
These millionaires need to step up & get vaccinated.,0,
"Many scientists, doctors and nurses advise not to get the vaccine",1,
Im not a sheep and wont be getting a shot that was rushed out!! A scared population is easy to control and thats what our government wants!!think for yourselves ppl!!!,1,
"If the vaccine actually worked, the vaccinated wouldn't have to worry about the unvaccinated.",1,
"This is such total bs, the cdc announced yesterday that this vaccine they are pushing is ineffective . But, we know this, vaxed can still get and more importantly spread this virus. Its pointless. How much are these companies getting paid to ruin employees lives. Its truly pathetic.",1,
I will gladly be fired before taking the jab. Big lawsuits will follow after the mid-terms.,1,
"Smarter than all the ""adults"" who are refusing it!",0,
Very true however the outcome is much much better the Mayo Clinic John Hopkins University The Lancet all have excellent regular updates to keep us informed !,0,
that's ok! In two years they will be mouthy teenagers anyway! Parents will welcome the quiet!,0,
amazing how many are scared of a life saving vaccine vs a serious deadly virus,0,
Is their any chance this has been a wake up call to the youth of today ? Believe in science first & not the Hollywood world the are surrounded by very hard to find the truth in the World we live in !,0,
A generation that can be so easily manipulated....,1,
To each their own. The vaccine does not make you immune to COVID-19. Just because you get the vaccine does not mean you cannot get COVID-19.,1,
In two years the vaccine will take over the body and they will all turn to zombies,1,
"This is the follow-up question that everyone wants answered today. What about those 32338406 people who were ""Confirmed Cases"" in the U.S. during the last year? Why do they need to be vaccinated since they have natural immunity? Secondary question is how did those New York Yankee players end up with COVID-19? They were fully-vaccinated !!!",1,
And which branch of science is your doctorate in?,1,
The vaccine is useful. but I do not doubt that a strong immune system can fight it off without vaccination,0,
Nanette Heathman um getting the shot is better than dying.,0,
Nanette Heathman you are unvaccinated and can still get sick. Get the shot to save yourself.,0,
Here's a ky study that shows covid survivors reinfection vac vs un vac. Spoiler- Vaxed survivors much better off https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7032e1.htm,0,
Total BS. It's now proven... no one has natural immunity. Many covid-19 patients caught it more than once and get hospitalized. And it's already proven in US with >620K deaths - path via natural immunity will be a disaster - with lots of people to die along the way. If it wasn't for the vaccine US probably would've added at least another 300K deaths more to what we already have.,0,
Lydia E. Moseley moderna said their vaccine only provides coverage for 6 months. So there are a bunch people walking around with their card but no immunity.,1,
Nanette Heathman your immunity is not forever. You may only have immunity for 3 months up to 10 months. You can definitely get it again.,1,
Ann MoDe amd then you need a booster because they didnt work.Why take the jab if you arent getting sick? Why risk having the virus in your system if you havent been affected for almost 2 yrs,1,
Lindie Black and many who have received the covid shots have also died  from covid,1,
I had covid in November  got the J$J shot in March....but I'm still careful. I probably have immunity  but still wear mask and stay 6 feet from others,1,

making progress!,0,
For all you parents who are excited about this you do know that the vaccine does not prevent transmission Plus the cdc just announced that kids should be masked in in school regardless of vax status,0,
Its still hasn't been fda approved so it would be making these kids part of an experiment,1,
Theyre firing them because they refuse to get the vaccine A lot of cops are career scumbags anyway so this will help them hire better cops,1,
Chicago more kids die from street Violence yet Chicago is Firing police officers Not Political at all,1,
"Sick is not the same as death, kids get sick all the time I was told at the hospital (way b4 Covid-19) they need to get sick to Build a healthy immune system Covid-19 is no different  but all do respect do what you think is best and luck to us all from this government control",1,
Glad to hear this My kids will definitely be getting them as soon as possible Thankfully my 4 year old will be turning 5 next month,0,
not to bright are you,1,
About 40 million have had Covid-19 and fully recovered natural immune works since the Birth of humankind,0,
thats so great My 4 year old has just over 6 months left so Im hoping 2-4 is authorized sooner,0,
The vaccine is as safe as Covid-19 for kids  so makes sense just like eating Vegetables,0,
Lmao. Fecking science is getting ridiculous,1,
This is a joke ! Stay the hell away from the kids they arent Guinea pigs,1,
keep this poison away from your children remember tens and thousands of healthcare workers are not even taking the jab. why is that? A mandate is not a law.,1,
More garbage,1,
How idiotic & childish,1,
"Clearly, vaccines work",0,
Its because you have had so many good healthcare workers fired!! Such a sad day when amazing nurses and doctors have to make such a horrible decision to provide for their family or comply with tyranny,0,
"Got mine yesterday at Walmart, others were their getting Covid or flu shot too! Thank you! ",0,

"No.
They do not know what the long terms effects are.
My daughter-in-law is a nurse.
A baby she delivered will not be ok, because the mom decided to get the shot and the baby got it also and it had a stroke because of it.",1,
oh HELL TO THE NO!,1,
oh there are risks? And benefits? No thank you! Just take your chances.,1,
"500 deaths under the age of 18, in 2 years",1,
Why risk it when you know it doesn't stop everyone from getting the China Virus? Makes sense to wait to see if they are able to come up with a real vaccine that actually prevents the illness.,0,
"Of course it doesnt. The data says that kids are more likely to develop. However, if cases of COVID-19 were to fall to the low levels last seen in June, the FDA predicted the U.S. might not see enough severe COVID-19 cases in children to outnumber the incidents of myocarditis or pericarditis.",1,
Almost like death isn't the only consequence,1,
I've seen too many videos of people administering the shots without first drawing back on the plunger to make sure the needle isn't in a blood vessel BEFORE administering the vaccines. Studies indicate that this error results in serious harm or death.,0,
"pretty sure most of the doctors that have been censored agree that the real reason people are dying in the hospitals is from the ""medicinal"" Remdesivir poisoning that causes the organs to fill with fluid and the lungs to fill with water. They label that covid-19 death.",0,

That study isn't even peer-reviewed yet it's a preprint. It literally says it shouldn't be used to guide medical practice yet this is lazy and irresponsible reporting,1,
even 50% effectiveness is exponentially better than nothing. The desperation is funny to watch as their blind loyalty is literally killing them.,1,
Horrible headline. When what you wanted to say is that you can still get it but still protective against severe illness. Do better please,1,
That's so you can get your booster hahahaha they need the lab rats for the booster and Big Pharma can make more money. Follow the money.,1,
Yeah I'll take my chances with 50% effectiveness. Hell even 10. Anything to curb the spread and squash this forever.,1,
The difference between Pfizer and Moderna is Pfizer has to be diluted and Moderna does not. This was the information that made my decision to get the Moderna shot. Modern is still 93% effective 6 months later.,0,
"Just like how the seasonal flu vaccine effectiveness is ""revised"" every year from the 80-90+ percent clinical model to more like 30% efficacy in real world applications. No surprise. These vaccines are not a panacea. People need to accept that and adjust their habits according to their own tolerance for risk",0,
Declining effectiveness is still better than not getting vaccinated.,0,
Its a study that was not particularly good had a ton of unknowns and basically said- need more studies.,0,
Still a higher effectiveness than we were all hoping for a year ago,0,
It is ridiculous that people freak out over this. As if the state owns you. They want you to do one thing. All the other things you do in life you can still do. They're just asking you to do something for your fellow citizens. It is selfish and stupidnot to do it and I am so sorry that you are stuck in some sort of mental trap that puts you in situations to make such poor decisions. I sincerely mean it I am sorry your mind works the way it does. It has to be hard to be like that.,1,
Thank you for justice,0,
Lets just imagine if parents had blocked the polio vaccine.,0,
Jacob Campbell we had the building blocks for this type of vaccine already in production years before covid hit (mrna vaccines are a potential cancer treatment). And we have now had two years of usage and study for these specific ones. The rest of theworld produced their own in this time frame as well. Do you want the Indian vaccine? The Swedish one? The Chinese one? The Cuban one? The British one? I cant believe this argument is still happening,1,
I mean...they have been requiring vaccines for years. This is just a new vaccine.,0,
Before you know theyre going to make kids get vaccines to enroll in school!,1,
Aaron Wagner Words of ignorance and selfishness for those that can't take it.have had bad side effects from it or have died from it.,1,
It didn't need to be mandated. Parents wanted their kids to not die.,1,
Judy Hauser it was never mandated.,0,
Judy Hauser Just think they gave the Polio vaccine in the classroom. It would be blasphemous in current times. You know we're in sad times when the TGA is currently manufacturing modern day iron lungs.,0,
I love when the president gives himself new powers and makes up his own mandates without going through our elected representatives who are supposed to write the laws. Fascism and tyranny are hot this year!,1,
I would consider this an IQ test for businesses. If youre not smart enough to get a free vaccine that could save your life then you shouldnt be working at that company.,0,
One million people came across southern border and we just let them loose,1,

good from what I hear the nurses office is already full of kid with potential covid cases,0,
FDA doesn't want the booster shots out yet because they want more testing to seev if the people are really going to need them but guess what CDC wants to go through with the booster now what does that tell you,0,

Vaccine is not going to rid the virus as long as man keeps making a virus that is resistant to each vaccine being made.,1,
"First I heard, get the vaccine, that way you won't get covid. Now I hear, get the vaccine, you won't be as sick with the covid.",1,
Doctors are already seeing complications from people who received the vaccine yet no one wants to report those facts.,1,
"We have 4% of the world population and 20% of the world Covid deaths. Look at your own numbers here. In the last week we've almost as many infections as India, with a billion more people than we have. And a death rate not far from half ours. I can think of no measure by which that isn't awful. Yes, there are countries with higher death rates. But our high infection rate is obviously a huge problem. And it's escalating.",1,
The police unions are resisting vaccine mandates.  Guess what the number one cause of death for police officers was last year and this year?  Yep. Covid.,1,
You don't have to shut up. You don't have to obey. You're free to leave your job and go find one where a vaccine is not required. Complain about it as loudly and publicly as you want.,1,
"Funny how hospitals in some areas are filling up with the unvaccinated who have COVID. If you have such little confidence in medical science, why go to the hospital?",1,
Public health officials in PA have lost all credibility. It seems like they were hiding the data to promote vaccination.,1,
"And a child's immune system is 99.98% effective, with none of the adverse events or nanobots swimming around inside them. It's a no brainer.",0,
"Let's get those kids vaccinated , everyone stay safe out there and keep those vaccines coming. More is better than less !!!!",0,
"When enough people in a community are vaccinated, it can provide protection to everyoneeven those who have not been vaccinated. It does so by reducing the number of people able to spread the infection within that community, a process referred to asherd immunity.5 This is how public health officials have been able to eliminate (or nearly eliminate) diseases like polio,mumps, andmeasles, which once claimed millions of lives. When diseases aren't able to spread, they eventually die out.",0,
"Cant wait until I get my booster shot, this vaccine will be the new norm especially for the the older folks and anyone with pre existing conditions. Remember to get a flu shot soon, this will also help and the flu bug was here to stay years ago, you can receive both at the same time. Stay safe out there. Like these red hats attacking a New York store owner, Guess they cant read the sign before entering the store.",0,
"Got my notice to schedule my booster shot this morning, thanks to AHN made an appointment on line and I'm good to go ! A free shot, who can turn that down?",0,
Those who refused to get vaccinated are going to have so many hospital bills. I dont know why anyone wouldnt do all they could to avoid getting sick.,0,
Funny how many people find sick people to be hilarious. Man gotta love how pro-life we are.,0,
Just get vaccinated already! Its simple and can save your life.,1,
These statistics are really scary.,0,
I don't believe these numbers,0,
Also an entire hospital system fits on one chart. Thats a miniscule percent of even hospital patients.,0,
This is a good.visual that is taking off on state sites as well. They need to add the second chart that breaks it into age ranges with normalized populations like Wisconsin department of health site does. The order of magnitude severe outcome reduction is compelling and those two pieces of data really tell the story well. That will be important as we keep getting higher vax rates because Ive seen much misinformation be pushed aboit countries that are 95% vaxed that those two graphs canneaily.and quickly show are BS.,1,
So what you are saying is that it is like with covid. Patients that also had Pneumonia and/or influenza were called covid deaths. Got it. Seriously you liberals have to stop assuming that you are smarter than conservatives.,1,

So happy both of my parents can get their first shot this week!,0,
"Got mine at Petco Park yesterday. Made my appointment on line with the help of my granddaughter. Left Linda Vista at approximately 12:20 and got back home at 1:30. Didn't even feel the needle go in my arm and so far so good. Lots of people/cars 75 and over were there. It was raining 'cats and dogs', but everything ran smoothly.",0,
Great way to end my Birthday week,0,
Im getting mine today,0,
The faster you get the vaccine the quicker we get back to normal. If you don't believe this then you don't know how to play chess.,0,
People who force other to take drugs they dont want should be in prison .,1,
wtf consequences REALLY this is the USA the LAND OF THE FREE key word FREE with all do seriousness people wake up they are taking our FREEDOM,1,
"Their body, their choice. Likewise, no vaccine, more restrictions.",1,
Who the hell knows what is in these vaccines. I've heard everything from spike proteins and graphene oxide to crazy aluminum creatures. Tons of vaccine injuries and deaths. How come people who got vaxxed are getting covid? Really don't believe what the media is telling us. ,1,
ABSOLUTELY NO CONSEQUENCES THIS IS A FREE COUNTRY AND WE HAVE RIGHTS. MY BODY MY RIGHT. NO WAY WILL I SACRIFICE MY RIGHT MY CHOICE. AND YOU SHOULD NOT BE OK,1,
I think the vaccine does help some people I got it but still got covid I'm not against it but it should be a individual choice not a mandate and people shouldn't get mad at those that choose not to take it,0,
"Just like the flu shot, when the virus mutates, changes, etc., and we are looking at multiple versions, annual updates are required. We fully expected boosters would be and will be needed with Covidgot mine today!",0,
Please go get vaccinated we want to keep you all around a little longer,0,
"I dont care what you call it , if it keeps me alive lm in!",0,
I would take the shot every month if I had to. I don't know what is in any vaccines and had to take those before starting school.,0,
It was never meant to cure. If it did then the liberals in power would lose their power to put fear in us.,1,
"Nope. The more I hear the government and media tell me I need to get it, the less chance that I will. Nobody can be trusted less than the government and media.",1,
Because they don't work..... If it doesn't stop transmission or contraction it's not worth taking..,1,
"The true answer, one that no pharma exec, politician or media will say is this is NOT a vaccine. Its a treatment. Calling it a 'vaccine' is malpractice and has done more harm because of it.",1,
I know why they dont last. Because they can make a lot more money if they can keep on selling them. And also so that the Democrats can steal a few more elections.,1,
Relieved for all the parents who have been worrying.,0,
No thanks not my kids do all the illegal aliens first,1,
No grandstanding or whining just being responsible government employees. They did the right thing toward others without all the political BS,0,
It seems that once a week should be enough. Whos paying for the testing since the shots are free.? But whatever it takes so everyone is protected & wearing masks.,0,
"Who's paying for the testing? If the employees are, good. If not, it's an unnecessary tax burden on the School District. Do the right thing and get vaccinated.",0,
Those 2250 staff members deserve a raise.,0,
Good luck with that. Parents still have the last word,1,
FYI: People who are in an active addiction are at a higher risk for EVERYTHING.,1,
"Sounds like someone is continuing to enjoy ""the best government money can buy."" How sad that the GOP continues to lose its ever smaller bag of integrity.",1,
"The system is failing, people are suffering and then there is this",1,
How many harmful drugs has the FDA approved?,0,
Manipulative ploy,0,
you're the one being lied to and the worst part is you don't even know it,0,
Communism at its finest,0,
I hear covid calling you.,0,
Sensible approach get vaccinated!!,1,
the plan is get the vaccination. thats the only way to end perpetual pandemic.,1,
Thank God! So glad the vaccine are there,1,
Yeah you're right no one who got the vaccine got covid..,1,
Jason wow man how cool and edgy of you.,1,
I have a friend who had a shingles outbreak after getting the Covid vaccine.He knew two other people that had the same reaction.Is there a Facebook page to report this,1,
Why on earth would they need to bribe you if this was not poison,1,
Its not a vaccine if it doesnt vaccinate.Quit being played by all those pushing the scam jab.They dont care about your health. Its all about power and control.Refuse. Resist. Fight back.,1,
Can you imagine being gullible enough to get these experimental not trial tested shots only to find out they dont work and you need  booster shots  for years to come?,1,
Vaccine junkies UNITE,1,
This is great,0,
Thats excellent.,0,
Fantastic,0,
Great,0,
None are dying so thats good,0,
Seems fair and provides enough time to get vaccinated. Some may make the choice to change professions.,0,
How many of these positive cases have been vaccinated? Im hearing from within the hospital that its about 50%. Sounds about as effective as an immune system.,0,
Personally if a booster is mandated Id like to be first in line.,0,
if youd read anything about it there are medical/religious exemptions. However just choosing not to take the vaccine isnt an option.,0,
a vaccine does not stop you from getting the virus. with any vaccine ot just lessens your chances of it being fatal,0,
What is with this freakin shot?? 99.9% chance of survival this is getting out of control!!!,1,
If the vax works why is it not working?,1,
no science to these laws just tyrannical policies,1,
the latest defraud based on fraud and pseudoscience magic enchantments,1,
This is bull guess Im quitting my job,1,
Backing the Blue,0,
Thanks to doctors,0,
Last years heros todays enemies,1,
Still a 99 percent survival rate for those under 65,0,
It is a tyrannical Covid vaccine mandate not a law,1,
I am sick of seeing all of the politicians getting this,1,
the stupidity never ends,1,
we are all shocked at this,1,
Say YES to vaccine,0,
This offers me hope,0,
Good. Save the organs for people who believe in science.,0,
I'm so happy to have my booster. I have no worries Of dying. None. I may get sick but not end up in the ER.,0,
"Here comes all the experts, pro-vax and anti-vax..no matter what, there are legit arguments for both. I can only worry about my family and what we decided to do about getting vaccinated. I didnt read news on my Facebook timeline, I spoke with doctors and virologist on my own. People I know in real life. Which I am glad I did, my sons had to stop taking a medication that could have caused a possible reaction to the vaccine",0,
Take the vaccine so we can all get back to life as normal and kick this virus to the curb,0,
Give it to me today and Ill be glad to take it,0,
Appear safe??????? Hell no !!!!,1,
"Because those vaccinated and received their boosters still get corona! And spread it	1",1,
The unvaccinated are ELEVEN TIMES more likely to die of Covid than fully vaccinated people.,1,
People are dying fully vaccinated .,1,
Still don't trust the vaccines nor this horrible govt in place socialism. Control.,1,

The vaccine is harm for kids,1,
COVID 19 vaccine gets weak anti-body response,1,

I would imagine 3 doses reduces this further. I was also thinking since we know pediatric basically removes misC which could be characterized as a long covid symptom this shouldn't be surprising. #GetVaccinated,0,
#CovidVaccine- Scare!!Be careful ,1,
"Well, just had my #1stDose of the #AstraZeneca #OxfordVaccine for #COVID19",0,

Standing strong with #100Crore Covid vaccinations administered today.,0,
Guess what? Just now. Just today. Vaccine is the only way.,0,
"This is my first dose at all the time of pandemic, finally I convinced myself to got my vaccine.",0,
The fact that people even consider getting a vaccine baffles me,1,
"To make public opinion believe that even the creator of the #plandemic is infected, he will never take a #covidvaccine ",1,
Just got my #2nd #CovidVaccine  now me and my whole #Family are #vaccinated yes,0,
Here is my covid vaccine update and 3 major reasons why I am getting my kids.  ,1,
I just got my 2nd dose!!! Im finally done,1,
Holy shit guys I feel like I got hit by a car all day been having chills and super fatigue. Only supposed to last 24 hours or less but still wasnt expecting that,1,
My wife got her #2nddose of the #Pfizer #CovidVaccine today.,0,
"CovidVaccines are our path to better days - so make sure you get your second dose when you can . I got mine today , and I couldn't be more grateful for the health care workers who've made this all possible .",0,
"Corona Vaccines are safe and effective don,t be a fool. get the vaccine soon.",0,
Taking vaccines is our best solution to fight the pandemic of covid-19.,0,
The COVID-19 vaccine may bring a side effect that women need to be aware of: changes to their menstrual period. Here's what you should know. #30Seconds @laceyadunn #covid19 #covidvaccine #coronavirus #womenshealth https://t.co/ckiSrIgWio,1,
"It would be wise for people to get their #3rddose done #ASAP!
Recent #hospitalization dada in #US - Miami-Dade clear showed lower hospital admission for people who had #boosters compared to only had",0,
I forsee our life policies compelling us to vaccinate,1,
These aches are something else Fuck this.,1,
Covid infection is less severe if vaccinated.,0,
Im almost positive they have enough. People arent lining up to get more shots.,1,
"Covid gives folks clotting disorders, yes",1,
The vaccine needs vaccinated,1,
"No one believes you anymore. It was a good run, but youve lost all confidence and credibility. Give it up.",1,
Have to keep the big boys shareholders happy ??,1,
For a shot that loses efficacy at 12 weeks?,1,
You're going to prison for crimes against humanity. You know the dangers of the vaccine and keep pushing it. Nuremberg trials await you.,1,
Retirement money off all those kickbacks must be rolling in huh?,1,
"And just like the flu shot, it only gives a few months protection. Also, just like flu shots, I'll continue to not take them. But you do you.",1,
Zero human testing? Thats a hard pass for me.,1,
"I pray one day the CDC pays for all this medical lying. This vaccine is not safe for kids or adults, the side effects are never talked about and in fact hidden by this very organization.",1,
Yes! All my nieces and nephews are vaccinated.,0,
I literally cannot believe yall are still trying to push this! Its over. Dead. Finished. Let it go!,1,
Can you explain all the deaths after getting the jab? How about all the athletes that were forced to get the jab and now they are either dead or have had heart attacks.,1,
"There is a special circle of hell for those who give the covid shot to infants, children and pregnant women.",1,
Save your children. Get them vaccinated,0,

We have no idea!,1,
child sacrifice right in your face,1,

The fascists are desperate to convince you that you need to live in fear. Nothing that they come up with surprises me,1,
"So far, whatever booster is being pushed out, people still get infected. And getting reinfected. And many have long linger cough too.",1,
Can the people wake up please and throw out the PAP,1,
Breathing freshly with zero shots,1,
This covid 19 experimental vaccine has given the word vaccine a negative connotation from my personal experience.,1,
The pharma companies with the vaccine technology will surely be sad when covid is GONE !,1,
"New vaccines are manufactured as fast as McDonald's hamburger, so high-tech it only needs a few monkeys to confirm it's safe to use.",1,
If it is endemic.. mean vaccine are optional like flu vaccine as j never took flu vaccine after BCG!!!,1,
Good luck to you if you trust this or them,1,
Pharmas holding the world at random,1,
Nature immune system is the best!??,1,
Wah...ur vaccines are more scary than the virus leh,1,
If Vaxsines were of any great use VS immunity then why do you still get flu?,1,
Crimes against humanity right here. For all of us to see,1,
Do not give your kids this poison,1,
Kids and teens do jot need to be vaccinated for Covid. They are more at risk of dying from Pneumonia TV than covid,1,
"A study conducted at the Seattle Childrens Hospital of children suffering myocarditis following their second dose of the Pfizer mRNA vaccine was published in the Journal of Pediatrics on 25 March 2022.
Or  what has once considered a full dose is deadly enough  patients should NEVER continue with the third or fourth for nonsense.",1,
This is evil. You all belong in jail.,1,
"all this tells me , is cha ching cha ching,,,,,make me richer , says the big pharm",1,
Not safe not effective. . . Quit lying,1,
Natural immunity is vastly superior. 89% of the population already had covid. Throw these shots in the garbage,1,
All this is for profit they don't care about the kids just money in their pockets,1,
Best advice: dont do it,1,
Seriously! Wtf is wrong with this world.. Do not give this to your precious children!,1,
Corrupt pathological criminals.????????????,1,
Yes! All my nieces and nephews are vaccinated,0,
Kids don't need them actually.,1,
